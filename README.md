# Sovol-SV06-Inline-BLTouch-mount

The model is a sturdy bracket designed to address the X-axis twist problem that can occur in certain 3D printers. It aligns the printer's probe with the nozzle axis, reducing probe error and resulting in more consistent prints. The bracket attaches to existing M3 screw holes and has a height adjustment of +5mm/-5mm. It works with stock fan and the SV06 5015 Fan Duct from NAM1025. While there are some drawbacks, such as reduced access to the extruder filament tension knob and limitations on the minimum X probing position, the benefits of the bracket in improving print accuracy and consistency outweigh the limitations.
